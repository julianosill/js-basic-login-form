# Login form in Javascript - Entry level

A very basic login form page to practice my skills in Javascript, HTML and CSS

### Functions
- Check if email and password inputs are not empty
- Password must have at least 8 characters
- Button must be disabled when attempting login
- Shows an alert in case of successful login
- Shows a warning with the reason the login failed
- *Obs.: checkbox is not functional, it's just for visual purpose.*
